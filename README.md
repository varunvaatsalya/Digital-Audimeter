# [Digital Audiometer - Web Version](https://digital-audimeter.vercel.app/)


This project is a web-based digital audiometry platform developed as part of **SIH 2023**. It helps users assess their hearing ability by generating audio samples at different frequencies and intensities.

## How to Use

On the first page, you will find a simple guide on how to perform the hearing test and interact with the platform.

## Audiometer Functionality

The second page contains the core audiometry functionality where users with hearing impairments can input their hearing responses to the audio samples.

## Left and Right Ear Frequency Testing

The audiometer allows users to test their hearing ability in **both ears** independently by generating audio samples at different frequencies for the left and right ear. During the test, the user will hear sound samples at various frequencies in one ear at a time. They can input their response based on their perception of the sound.

Below are examples of frequency testing for the left and right ear:

- **Left Ear Sample at 1000 Hz**:

- **Right Ear Sample at 800 Hz**:

These tests help to determine if the user has a hearing loss in one ear or both, and at which frequencies.

## Results

After completing the test, the results page will generate an audiogram, showing the user's hearing sensitivity at various frequencies.
